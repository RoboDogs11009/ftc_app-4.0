## Welcome!
This is the primary code for the McHi RoboDogs FTC team number 11009. This code was built using Java in Android Studio off of the sample pushbot code for Android Studio that was created by ftctechnh, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app).

If you are interested in our team's activity both in and out of the Pit, make sure to follow our social media accounts and website!
